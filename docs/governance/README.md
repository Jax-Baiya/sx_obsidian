# Documentation Governance

Owner: @devops

## Standards

Each maintained document should include:

1. Purpose
2. Preconditions
3. Steps
4. Verification
5. Rollback

## Lifecycle

- Prefer small PRs for doc updates tied to feature changes.
- Add/update cross-links in [`../INDEX.md`](../INDEX.md).
- Mark deprecated pages with an archival note and link to replacement.
